# Harp-mode

Writing tabs for the harmonica can get annoying. Converting from notes
to hole positions for your key or harmonica type (chromatic, diatonic,
tremolo etc) is easy, but error prone (for people like me) and easy to
automate. That's what Harp-mode tries to do.

## Features

* Note names to harp tabs in any key
* Display the layout of a harmonica in any key
* Convert tabs from diatonic to chromatic and back
* Closest match to diatonic notes without bending (for beginners!)
